# Budget Tracker
## Purpose
This app keeps track of your finances and is a simple graph application that when you add money it goes up and when you subtract it goes down.
## Functionality
The real reason this app was created though, was an excercise is PWA Creation.
A PWA is a progressive web application and it bascally just means that, through storing things in indexDB and using the cache, we are able to preserve functionality
even when the application loses access to the internet or there is some sort of interference.
The actual functionality is fairly simple, there's a button that increments and a button that decrememnts.
